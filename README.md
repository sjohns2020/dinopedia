## Brief
A client is looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing an interactive browser application that displays information about dinosaurs in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them. This may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.


## Possible future extensions to functionality
- Add a quiz on the index page (test knowledge about all dinosaurs in the app)
- Add a comments box (primarily to demonstrate database persistence)

## Dependencies
This project draws data from the [dinopix](https://github.com/judymou/dinopix) API, but only as a "run once" before the application is accessed for the first time; the API is only used as a setup step to source data which will be filtered and adapted to suit the needs of the project before loading it to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

## Getting Started
If you would like to demo the (prototype!) application as it exists at the moment, you'll need a few things...
- A contemporary web browser, such as Firefox or something WebKit/Blink based (Chromium, Chrome, Brave etc.)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

You'll need to fork a copy of the Dinopedia repository to your own account. Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) from GitHub.

1. Clone your new repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/ColetteDufficy/dinopedia`

2. Install all of the dependencies listed in `server/package.json`:
```
# Terminal
cd server
npm i
```

3. You'll need to create and seed your database:
```
# Terminal
cd server
npm run seeds
```

4. Install all of the dependencies listed in `client/package.json`:
```
# Terminal
cd client
npm i
```
  
5. Start the server:
```
# Terminal
cd server
npm start
```


6. Load the front-end:
```
# Terminal
cd client
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Group Project 
What you see in this repository is a group project by Team Dinomite, created as our final assignment for a software development course at CodeClan with the rest of cohort WD23. Individually, we are [Colette Dufficy](https://github.com/ColetteDufficy), [Sean Johnson](https://github.com/sjohns2020), [Heather Lamont](https://github.com/HeatherLamont), and [Xander Mackenzie](https://github.com/crabbit-git).


## Licence
There is currently no formal licence for this project, but this is not intended as a blanket grant of permission; the repository is public and you are permitted to clone a local copy for the demonstration purposes and/or to satisfy your own curiosity, but you would be doing so very much at your own risk as this code is provided without any warranty or guarantee of function whatsoever. It is also decidedly not for commercial use or adaptation for any other purpose at all, and is not in any way intended as a completed or production ready application; its purpose was entirely educational. In other words: it ain't our fault if you break anything after trying to use anything hosted in this repository.
